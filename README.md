# PIP
This is my semester project!
PIP - Plant Identification Program - helps the user identify a plant given certain features of the plant, the user's location, and the season

To run PIP, make sure all the image files and the text file (plants.txt) are in the same location as PIP.py (where the actual program is). 
Also, make sure you have the PIL and colorama libraries installed. 

When you run PIP.py, all user inputs go directly into the terminal. Finally, make sure you have a way to view .png files as you may get the chance to see images
of the plant you are trying to identify. 

Happy searching!
