Common name: Giant Hogweed
Scientific name: Heracleum mantegazzium
States: New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, Oregon, Washington, Michigan, Virginia, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine
Reactive to skin: Yes
Reactive to digestive system: No
Reactive to nervous system: No
Reactive to cardiac system: No
Reactive to respiratory system: No
Details: The sap from giant hogweed is phototoxic, which means that touching the sap strips away the skin's defense against sunlight. This species is particularly dangerous because it looks a lot like its less toxic cousing, Queen Anne's Lace. You can tell the difference by looking for a dot of purple flowers in the center of the white flower cap--that's the sign of Queen Anne's Lace.
If exposed: If skin contact was made with giant hogweed or its sap, wash affected area immediately with soap and cold water. Keep skin away from sunlight until inflammation subsides.

Common name: Pokeweed
Scientific name: Phytolacca americana
States: Oregon, Washington, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Louisiana, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Illinois, Tennessee, Mississippi, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Alabama, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Rhode Island, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland
Reactive to skin: Yes
Reactive to digestive system: Yes
Reactive to nervous system: No
Reactive to cardiac system: Yes
Reactive to respiratory system: Yes
Details: The stem, leaves, and berries of pokeweed are known emetics, which induce vomitting upon consumption. Eating raw pokeweed can also cause bloody diarrhea, convulsions, heart problems, and paralysis of respiratory organs. The sap can also cause allergic reactions in people with sensitive skin.
If exposed: If consumed, SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION. If sap has caused an allergic skin reaction, keep infected area clean and treat with anti-itch steroid creams.
